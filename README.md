## About Us

This calculator was created by Cody Carter and Rohan Patel, two computer engineering students with a shared goal: to develop an all-in-one application that simplifies and solves nodal analysis equations using a graphical interface—a lightweight and accessible alternative to MATLAB.

Rohan focused on building the backend and implementing additional UI features, while Cody integrated the backend into an intuitive, user-friendly interface.

We built this tool to help students and engineers quickly solve nodal or mesh analysis problems.
