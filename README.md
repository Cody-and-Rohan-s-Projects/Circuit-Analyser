# About Us
This calculator was designed by Cody Carter and Rohan Patel, two computer engineering students with a goal of creating an all-in-one application to simplify and solve nodal analysis linear equations as an GUI based alternative to MATLAB.
Rohan focused on creating the backend and additional UI features, while Cody helped implemented the backend into an intuitive UI. We built this calculator to help users quickly solve nodal or mesh analysis equations in an easy to use and lightweight standalone application that anyone can use.

# How To Install and Use
To use the application, download the most recent version from the releases tab. The file should run on 32 or 64-bit versions of Windows 7/8/8.1/10/11. If Windows shows a "Windows protected your PC" message, just click "More info" and then "Run anyway". Don't worry, this is just a standard Windows message that's shown to all programs without a signature. A Mac version is coming soon.

# About The Calculator

The calculator supports systems of equations which have 1-4 variables. Start by selecting the size of the matrices from the dropdown menu, and click the "Set Size" button to confirm. Enter the values for coefficents and the constants into the respective matrices and click the "Solve" button.
These values can be either real numbers or complex numbers in rectangular form. If the matrix or values are invalid, an error will be displayed.
The solution will be shown in both rectangular and polar form. Below the solution will be the KVL equations associated with the solution.
Select the "Dark Mode" slider to change the application's theme or the "Always on Top" slider to keep the calculator above all over windows.

# Releases And Feature Updates

Currently, there are plans to support polar form complex numbers in the entry fields. Suggestions for future features are welcome! The calculator is still work in progress, so expect more to come.
